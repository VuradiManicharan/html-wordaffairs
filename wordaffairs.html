            Pakistan has objected to Prime Minister 
Narendra Modi's visit to Kashmir and 
laying of foundation stones for the 
construction of the Rattle and Kwar 
hydroelectric projects on the Chenab 
River, which it claimed was a "direct 
contravention" of the Indus Waters Treaty.
        </p>
    <h2>Details</h2>
    
<p>
    Mr. Modi laid the foundation stone of the 
Rattle and Kwar hydroelectric projects, an 850 
MW facility to be constructed on the Chenab 
River in Kishtwar at a cost of around Rs 5,300 
crore, and a 540 MW Kwar hydroelectric 
project to be built on the same river at a cost 
of over â‚¹4,500 crore.
